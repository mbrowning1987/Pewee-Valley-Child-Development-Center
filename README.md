# Pewee-Valley-Child-Development-Center
A revamped website for Pewee Valley Presbyterian Child Development Center
This is just a side project for me. The current daycares website is ok, but I want to see if I can make it better. There are still a lot of 
spelling and grammer issues, but I want to get everything up onto the page, than Ill proof read everything.
My goal for this site, is to put enough information online, which would hopefully reduce the amount of calls to the office. Which in turn would
free up office personal for other things. There are times, a potential parent calls , and whoever answers is on the phone with them for 30 minutes. 
That 30 minutes could be eliminated, if the right information was online for them to look at. Just a thought!!!!
